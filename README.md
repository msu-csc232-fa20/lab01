# lab01

An excursion into working with arrays in C++.

## Background

Arrays are one of the first "data structures" introduced in introductory programming classes. An array contains a number of data items, or **entries**, that have the same data type. In memory, each of these entries reside in _contiguous_ memory locations.

## Getting Started

1. Accept the GitHub Classroom Assignment Link provided to you in Microsoft Teams for Lab 1 - Arrays
1. Using Git Bash once your repository has been created, clone it to your local machine

   ```bash
   $ git clone <url-of-your-repository>
   ```

1. Now navigate into this cloned repository

   ```bash
   $ cd lab01-<your-github-username>
   ```

1. Before you get started on any work, let's create the `develop` branch and push it to `origin`.

   ```bash
   $ git checkout -b develop
   $ git push -u origin develop
   ```

## Tasks

This lab is composed of three parts:

1. Part 1: Exploring one-dimensional arrays
1. Part 2: Exploring the indexes and addresses of arrays
1. Part 3: Exploring what happens when we index arrays improperly

As you follow along in this lab assignment, you'll be asked to

1. Erase `TODO` comments in this `README.md` file
1. Add and/or edit files.
1. Commit your changes.
1. Push your changes to GitHub

In the end, i.e., after your final commit and push, you'll be asked to create a pull request and then submit the URL of your repository in a Microsoft Teams assignment.

### Part 1: Exploring one-dimensional arrays

1. Create a file name `array.cpp` that contains the following stub:

   ```c++
   #include <cstdlib>
   #include <iomanip>
   #include <iostream>
   #include "lab01.h"

   int main()
   {
       return EXIT_SUCCESS;
   }
   ```

   A stub is a complete program fragment that will compile but won't necessarily do anything. To verify your stub is syntactically correct, compile, link and execute this program using the following commands (in a Cygwin terminal window, or any shell available on your system) from your working directory (the root folder of your repository):

   ```bash
   $ g++ -Wall -std=c++11 -o lab01 array.cpp
   $ ./lab01.exe
   ```

   When you execute these commands, you will discover that nothing happens. It compiles and links, but when executed, it doesn't do anything. Not a big surprise, right?

   Now that we're confident our stub compiles and executes, let's commit our changes.

   ```bash
   $ git add array.cpp
   $ git commit -m"LAB01 - Complete Part 1, Step 1."
   ```

1. Next, add two `typedef` statements of the form

   ```c++
   typedef array-element-type type-name[array-size];
   ```
   
   ahead of `main()` to define the two data types:
   
   `IntegerArray` for arrays with 16 integer elements
   `CharArray` for arrays with 10 character elements
   
    Save your file and commit your changes.

   ```bash
   $ git add array.cpp
   $ git commit -m"LAB01 - Complete Part 1, Step 2."
   ```

1. Inside the `main()` function, declare and initialize an `IntegerArray` variable `prime` to be an array containing the 16 integers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, using a declaration of the form:

   ```c++
   type-name array-name = {comma-separated-list-of-values};
   ```

    Save your file and commit your changes.

    ```bash
   $ git add array.cpp
   $ git commit -m"LAB01 - Complete Part 1, Step 3."
   ```

1. Check that the array has been initialized properly by writing a `for` loop to display the elements of `prime`. Then recompile and execute your program (as you did in Step 1) to check if your statements are correct.

   Use `std::setw(n)` and `std::right` IO manipulators to produce right-aligned output that looks like this:
   
   ```text
   prime[ 0] =  2
   prime[ 1] =  3
   prime[ 2] =  5
   prime[ 3] =  7
   prime[ 4] = 11
   prime[ 5] = 13
   prime[ 6] = 17
   prime[ 7] = 19
   prime[ 8] = 23
   prime[ 9] = 29
   prime[10] = 31
   prime[11] = 37
   prime[12] = 41
   prime[13] = 43
   prime[14] = 47
   prime[15] = 53
   ```

   Once you have your program working properly, commit your changes:


    ```bash
   $ git add array.cpp
   $ git commit -m"LAB01 - Complete Part 1, Step 4."
   ```

1. An initializer list with too many values is an error. Some compilers detect this error while others do not. Those that do not may allow the program to actually compile and run, and this will result in errors. Now you are to test your particular compiler to determine its behavior.

   What happens when you try to compile a statement with too many values in the initializer list? You can find out by adding one or more values to your initializer list for `prime`. Do this, recompile and execute the program, and then describe what happens below:
   
   ```text
   TODO: Erase this line and put your answer in this text block.
   ```

   Once you've placed your answer in the above text block, save this (README.md) file and commit your changes:

   ```bash
   $ git add README.md
   $ git commit -m"LAB01 - Complete Part 1, Step 5."
   ```

1. It is not an error to give too few values in the initializer list of an array.

   What happens in this case? You can find out by changing the initialization of `prime` to use fewer than 16 integers and outputting the array elements. Do this, recompile and execute the program, and then describe what happens below:
   
   ```text
   TODO: Erase this line and put your answer in this text block.
   ```
   
   Once you've placed your answer in the above text block, save this (README.md) file and commit your changes:

   ```bash
   $ git add README.md
   $ git commit -m"LAB01 - Complete Part 1, Step 6."
   ```

1. Now you will repeat the experiment performed on the `IntegerArray` using a `CharArray`. First surround the declaration of the integer array `prime` and the `for-loop` that displays the elements with macros to remove it from compilation:

   ```c++
   #if EXECUTE_BLOCK
   
   // statements to ignore when EXECUTE_BLOCK is set to FALSE
   // in the lab01.h file
   
   #endif
   ```
   
   When you have blocked out the integer array `prime` and the `for` loop, then declare the `CharArray` variable `animal` initializing it with the characters `'r', 'h', 'i', 'n', 'o', 'c', 'e', 'r', 'o', 's'`. Check that the array has been properly initialized by adding a `for` loop that displays the elements of `animal` followed by something like `****`, all on the same line. Do this, recompile and execute the program, and then describe what happens (i.e., what gets printed) below:
   
   ```text
   TODO: Erase this line and put your answer in this text block.
   ```

   Once you've placed your answer in the above text block, save this (README.md) file and commit your changes:

   ```bash
   $ git add README.md
   $ git commit -m"LAB01 - Complete Part 1, Step 7."
   ```
   
1. Now check if adding one or more characters, i.e., adding too many initialization values, affects what happens. If so, add one or more characters and repeat the test. Do this, recompile and execute the program, and then describe what happens (i.e., what gets printed) below:

   ```text
   TODO: Erase this line and put your answer in this text block.
   ```

    Once you've placed your answer in the above text block, save this (README.md) file and commit your changes:

   ```bash
   $ git add README.md
   $ git commit -m"LAB01 - Complete Part 1, Step 8."
   ```
   
1. Now check what happens when there are fewer values in the initializer list. Remove all but the first five characters in the initializer list, recompile and execute the program, and then describe what happens (i.e., what gets printed) below:
                                                                                                                                                                                  
   ```text
   TODO: Erase this line and put your answer in this text block.
   ```

   Once you've placed your answer in the above text block, save this (README.md) file and commit your changes:

   ```bash
   $ git add README.md
   $ git commit -m"LAB01 - Complete Part 1, Step 9."
   ```
   
1. It may not be completely clear what happened when the uninitialized character array locations were reached. What did the output operator do when the `for` loop sent it the character array elements that had not been initialized? To see this, modify the output in the `for` loop to display the actual ASCII codes being generated for each character array element. (_Hint_: Use a static cast `static_cast<int>(animal[i])` to convert `char`s to `int`s.) Tell below what is used to initialize the uninitialized array elements.

   ```text
   TODO: Erase this line and put your answer in this text block.
   ```

   Once you've placed your answer in the above text block, save this (README.md) file and commit your changes:

   ```bash
   $ git add README.md
   $ git commit -m"LAB01 - Complete Part 1, Step 10."
   ```
   
1. Now try initializing the character array in a different way. Character arrays can also be initialized by using string literals like `"elephant"` -- so we can initialize the character array `animal` using the string literal in place of the curly brace initializer list syntax. We can also output a character array using `<<` directly, as in 

    ```c++
    std::cout << animal << "****\n";
    ```
   
   Make the necessary changes to use the string `"elephant"` and record what happens below.
   
   ```text
   TODO: Erase this line and put your answer in this text block.
   ```

   Once you've placed your answer in the above text block, save this (README.md) file and commit your changes:

   ```bash
   $ git add README.md
   $ git commit -m"LAB01 - Complete Part 1, Step 11."
   ```
   
1. Now repeat the test using the string `"rhinoceros"` instead. Describe what happens below.

   ```text
   TODO: Erase this line and put your answer in this text block.
   ```
   
   Once you've placed your answer in the above text block, save this (README.md) file and commit your changes:

   ```bash
   $ git add README.md
   $ git commit -m"LAB01 - Complete Part 1, Step 12a."
   ```

   You may have gotten a warning message, even though the array has been declared to have 10 elements. The reason is that the character arrays are terminated by **null characters**, `'\0'`, whose ASCII code is 0, provided there is room to store this character. Since functions that process character arrays and expect to find this null character at the end of the string that is stored, they may not work properly when there is none.

   Thus, character arrays such as `animal` that are used to store strings should be declared large enough to store at least one extra character at the end of each string value, namely, the null character. This character is used by functions that process strings stored in character arrays to mark the end of the string. To see how this is done:
   
   (i) Change the initialization string of `animal` to `"zebra"`.
   
   (ii) Now write C++ statements below that could be used to determine the length of the string stored in `animal`, that is, the number of non-null characters. Test that your code works by entering it into your program and executing it. (_Note_: For fun ;-), see if you can do this using a `for` loop with an empty body.)
   
   ```c++
   TODO: Put your snippet of code here.
   ```

   Once you've placed your snippet of code in the above text block, save this (README.md) file and commit your changes:

   ```bash
   $ git add README.md
   $ git commit -m"LAB01 - Complete Part 1, Step 12b."
   ```

_Remember_: The end-of-string mark (i.e., the null character `'\0'`) that gets placed at the end of each initialization string or a string that is input for a character array (e.g., `cin >> animal;`) provided that the character array has space for it. If it doesn't get stored, one cannot expect string operations and functions to work correctly. Thus, one must be sure the array is large enough so that it has space for this null character.

### Part 2: Exploring the indexes and addresses of arrays

1. Block out the declarations and statements involving the character array `animal`. Then add declarations of three arrays of type `IntegerArray` in the following order:

   `first` initialized to all 0s
   
   `arr` initialized to all 1s
   
   `last` initialized to all 2s
   
   Then add output statements to display the addresses of `first`, `arr`, and `last`.
   
   List the resulting addresses below.
   
   |variable|address|
   |--------|-------|
   |`first` | TODO: Put address here, e.g., 0x7ffff4086c60|
   |`arr`   | TODO: Put address here, e.g., 0x7ffff4086c60|
   |`last`  | TODO: Put address here, e.g., 0x7ffff4086c60|
   
   Note, to print these addresses as hexadecimal values as shown above, you can use the IO manipulator `std::hex` as in 
   
   ```c++
   std::cout << "Address of first: " << std::hex << &first << std::endl;
   ```
   
   How many bytes were allocated to each array? You can use the `sizeof(type)` or `sizeof variable-name` to verify you have the right size. Add code to your program to that... (don't forget to switch back to decimal values using the `std::dec` IO manipulator if you add this code after a previous manipulator to print hexadecimal values).
   
   ```text
   Each array was allocated <TODO: Put your answer here> bytes.
   ```

   Once you've placed your answer in the above text block, save this (README.md) file and commit your changes:

   ```bash
   $ git add README.md
   $ git commit -m"LAB01 - Complete Part 2, Step 1."
   ```

   Using the information you have developed, what do you think are the addresses of: 
   
   | array element | address |
   |---------------|---------|
   |`arr[2]`       | TODO: Put address here, e.g., 0x7ffff4086c60 |
   |`arr[3]`       | TODO: Put address here, e.g., 0x7ffff4086c60 |
   
   Add some code to your program that will give the addresses of `arr[2]` and `arr[3]`. List the results of your running code.
   
   | array element | address |
   |---------------|---------|
   |`arr[2]`       | TODO: Put address here, e.g., 0x7ffff4086c60 |
   |`arr[3]`       | TODO: Put address here, e.g., 0x7ffff4086c60 |
   
   Are they the same as your earlier guess? // TODO Answer yes or no
   
1. Now use the array variables `first`, `arr`, and `last` instead of `&first`, `&arr`, and `&last` in your output statement. Describe how the output changes (if it does). What can you conclude about the value of an array variable?

   ```text
   TODO: Write your answer here.
   ```

   Once you've placed your answer in the above text block, save this (README.md) file and commit your changes:

   ```bash
   $ git add README.md
   $ git commit -m"LAB01 - Complete Part 2, Step 2."
   ```
   
1. Next, add statements that display `&arr[0]`, `&arr[1]`, ... , `&arr[15]` and `arr`, `arr + 1`, ..., `arr + 15`. It's a good idea to do this with a `for` loop displaying `&arr[i]` and `arr + i` and vary `i` from 0 to 15. Based on the output produced, what can you conclude?

   ```text
   TODO: Write your answer here.
   ```

   Once you've placed your answer in the above text block, save this (README.md) file and commit your changes:

   ```bash
   $ git add README.md
   $ git commit -m"LAB01 - Complete Part 2, Step 3."
   ```
   
   What you've seen is that the index notation `&arr[i]` is equivalent to an address of the first array element plus and offset: `arr + i`; indeed the difference is _syntactical sugar_, two different ways of expressing the same thing. `arr + i` is the address of `arr[i]`.
   
1. Now, add statements to display the values of `arr[0]`, `arr[1]`, ..., `arr[15]` and also `*arr`, `*(arr + 1)`, ..., `*(arr + 15)` -- use a `for` loop. Based on the output produced, what can you conclude?

   ```text
   TODO: Write your answer here.
   ```

   Once you've placed your answer in the above text block, save this (README.md) file and commit your changes:

   ```bash
   $ git add README.md
   $ git commit -m"LAB01 - Complete Part 2, Step 4a."
   ```
   
   What happens if you remove the parentheses in the expressions `*(arr + i)`? Give an explanation below of why you think this happens: (_Hint_: Check the priorities of operators `*` and `+`.)
   
   ```text
   TODO: Write your answer here
   ```

   Once you've placed your answer in the above text block, save this (README.md) file and commit your changes:

   ```bash
   $ git add README.md
   $ git commit -m"LAB01 - Complete Part 2, Step 4b."
   ```
   
   This example shows that the _base-address_ + _offset_ notation `*(arr + i)` is equivalent to the array reference notation `arr[i]`. The array reference notation is generally preferred, since it is clearer and easier to understand. However, the `base-address` + `offset` notation reveals what is actually going on.
   
1. Add statements to your program so that the program lists all the elements of `first`, then all the elements of `arr`, and then all the elements of `last`. Compile and execute it to see that it operates properly.

   Once you've placed you're satisfied that the above operates as expected, save your source code (`array.cpp`) file and commit your changes:

   ```bash
   $ git add array.cpp
   $ git commit -m"LAB01 - Complete Part 2, Step 5."
   ```

### Part 3: Exploring what happens when we index arrays improperly

When we declare an array, we give it a capacity, i.e., a number of elements. One would think that the compiler should complain when we write code that does not obey these declarations and not allow us to do it. But that isn't necessarily the case. We will now explore what does happen when array indices get out of range.

1. To find out, add the following assignment statements _before_ the code you just added to output the array elements:

   ```c++
   arr[-10] = -999;
   arr[20]  = 999; 
   ```
   
   Now execute your program again. What array elements changed?
   
   ```text
   TODO: Write your answer here
   ```

   Once you've placed your answer in the above text block, save this (README.md) file and commit your changes:

   ```bash
   $ git add README.md
   $ git commit -m"LAB01 - Complete Part 3, Step 1a."
   ```
   
   Now add the following output statements and run your program again:
   
   ```c++
   std::cout << "\narr[-10]..arr[20]:\n";
   for (int i{-10}; i <= 20; ++i)
   {
       std::cout << arr[i] << " ";
   }
   ```
   
   Based on this output, you should be able to explain why the elements of `first` and `last` got changed "indirectly." Give your explanation below:
   
   ```text
   TODO: Write your answer here
   ```

   Once you've placed your answer in the above text block, save this (README.md) file and commit your changes:

   ```bash
   $ git add README.md
   $ git commit -m"LAB01 - Complete Part 3, Step 1b."
   ```
   
_Note that in the preceding code with illegal indices, if the array elements that were changed had contained critical information, they would have been corrupted. If they had contained program instructions, the program could crash. Clever people can sometimes exploit these kinds of features to introduce viruses and other kinds of malevolent code into programs._

## Submission Details

Once you have pushed your final changes to GitHub, create a _pull request_ that seeks to merge the changes in your `develop` branch into your `master` branch. When you are creating the pull request, be sure to select your lab instructor as a reviewer.

After creating the pull request, 

1. Look at the changes in your files. If it appears something is missing, make sure you've saved all your changes. If additional changes were saved, commit them and push them (your pull request will automatically get updated with the new commits).
1. When you're all done, submit the URL of your lab assignment's repository as a link submission.

## Due Date

This assignment is due by the end of the lab period. In order to avoid a late penalty, follow the steps outlined above, regardless if you completed all the steps detailed in this lab. Always push your final changes to GitHub, create your pull request and submit the details in Microsoft Teams.
